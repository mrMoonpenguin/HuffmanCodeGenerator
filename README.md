## How to use

1. Create a new .txt file with keys and frequencies. Write new entries on a new line and leave a space between key and frequency. Frequencies can be either relative or absolute, but stay consistent. Example:

```
a 5
b 25
c 3
```
or
```
a 0.1
b 0.3
c 0.6
```

2. Change directory in `Main` to this text file.
3. Run.
